title: Local Development Setup
---

## Requirements

* Runtime:
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.12.2+ LTS
  * [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/) v1.1+
  * [Deno](https://deno.com/) v1.40+ (optional)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager ([How to install](https://pnpm.io/installation))

By default, the backend is now using Bun and Frontend Node.js (can be changed). The plan is for everything to run in one runtime and mutual compatibility.

## Quickstart

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Clone [`@evermeet/evermeet`](https://github.com/evermeet/evermeet) repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:evermeet/evermeet.git
   cd evermeet
   ```

2. Install depedencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Run your development instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

</Steps>

Done, your development instance is up and running and available at the following addresses:

* Backend (api): http://localhost:3000/xrpc
* Frontend (web): http://localhost:3001

By default, the `config.yaml` [configuration file](/operation/configuration) is loaded from the project root directory.
