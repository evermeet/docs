title: System Architecture
---

We are currently developing a reference implementation [`@evermeet/evermeet`](https://github.com/evermeet/evermeet). This implementation is written in JavaScript, and executed using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Deno](https://deno.com/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime environment.

Future plan is to create implementations in other languages such as Rust or Go.

## Evermeet Instance

Evermeet Instance is the term for an application that contains both a [Backend](#backend-api) as an API and a [Frontend](#frontend-web) for clients.

## Backend (api)

The backend is the central part of an evermeet instance:

* handles most of the workflows
* connected to the [Database](#database) where the data is stored
* communicate with the [Frontend](#frontend-web) and clients
* communicate with other instances within the [Federation](/specs/federation)

Backend communicate with Frontend, clients and external instances through HTTP & WebSocket API ([XRPC](/specs/xrpc)) endpoints defined by [Lexicons](/specs/lexicon).

### Database

As a database, we currently use the storage-agnostic solution [RxDB](https://rxdb.info/), which allows the use of various storage solutions under the hood.


## Frontend (web)

The frontend is the web user interface through which users interact with the evermeet instance.
