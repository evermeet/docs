Each evermeet instance is automatically connected to a decentralized P2P network ([Federation](/federation/overview)) within which you can use a single identity and share information about events and calendars.

## Privacy-preserving

We value privacy, which is why evermeet is designed with privacy in mind. It is thus also suitable for organizers who value the privacy of their visitors.

## Community-based

Community is the foundation of our project. Without your feedback and interaction it would never work. Evermeet is made by the community for the community.

## Open-source

Evermeet is completely open-source under the benevolent MIT license.
