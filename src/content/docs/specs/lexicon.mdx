Lexicon is a schema definition language used to describe evermeet records, HTTP endpoints ([XRPC](/specs/xrpc)), and event stream messages.

We are currently using the [Lexicon definition language version 1](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon) specification as defined by the AT Protocol.

The schema language is similar to JSON Schema and OpenAPI.

## Namespaced Identifiers (NSIDs)

Namespaced Identifiers (NSIDs) are used to reference Lexicon schemas for records, XRPC endpoints, and more.

The basic structure and semantics of an NSID are a fully-qualified hostname in Reverse Domain-Name Order, followed by a simple name. The hostname part is the domain authority, and the final segment is the name.

For example: 
* `app.evermeet.object.getProfile`
* `app.evermeet.auth.createSession`
* `app.evermeet.server.describeServer`
