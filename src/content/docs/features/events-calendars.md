Management of **Events** or **Calendars** is a core functionality of the evermeet platform.

## Customizable Event page

Each event has its own page with all the details and a form for [registration or ticket purchase](/features/tickets-registration). Our goal is to make this page as accessible and customizable as possible.

## Calendar = group of events

Calendar is basically just a group of one or more events. This can be used in a variety of ways - the most common is to create a Calendar for your community, project or company and publish related events within it.

## Calendar subscriptions

## Synchronization with external services
