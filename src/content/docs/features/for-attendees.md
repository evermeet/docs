We also aim to help simplify and make event registration and tracking easier and more convenient for visitors.

## All events and calendars in one place

You can see all your [events and calendars](/features/events-calendars) in one place across the entire [federation](/federation/overview).

## Privacy-preserving

You have full control and visibility over what information you share about yourself with event organisers. By default, only your handle and avatar are shared (not email!).

## Single sign-on

You can use a single identity across all evermeet instances ([Federation](/federation/overview)) to log in and communicate with events or subscribe to calendars. The identity is provided by your *home instance* where you set up your account.

## Portable accounts

Thanks to [decentralized identifiers](/federation/did) (DID), you are not locked into one home instance forever, but can simply migrate your account and data to another at any time.
